# 組件

JavaFX 用戲劇來比喻 `Application`、`Stage`、`Scene` 之間的組織。

TornadoFX 用 `View`、`Controller`、`Fragment` 來構建。雖然 TornadoFX 也使用 `Stage`、`Scene`，但是 `View`、`Controller`、`Fragment` 提供了新的概念來讓開發的程式碼更精簡。大部分的組件都自動的維持單一物件 (singletons)，TornadoFX 也可以用依賴注入(simple dependency)，或是直接實例化(direct instantiation)。

您也可以利用 `FXML`，這會在第十章介紹。

首先，讓我們繼承 `App` 來創建一個 TornadoFX 應用程式的進入點。

## 應用程式(App) 和 View 基礎

要創建一個 TornadoFX 的應用程序，至少需要一個類別繼承(extends) `App`，`App` 是一個程序的進入點，也指定了初始的 `View`。他實際上繼承了 JavaFX 的 `Application` 類，但您並不需要指定 `start()` 和 `main()` 方法。

繼承 `App` 來創建應用，且須在建構子(constructor) 中的第一個參數中放入主要`view`。

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)
```

`View` 提供了顯示邏輯 (display logic) 和布局節點 (latout nodes)，就像是 JavaFX 中的 `Stage`，也被自動的以單一物件 (singleton)的方式管理。當你宣告了一個 `View`，你必須指地一個 `root` 屬性，可以是任何的父類，且會持有 view 的內容。

你可以在相同的 Kotlin 檔案，或是創建一個新的檔案來創建繼承 `View` 的類別。覆寫 `root` 屬性，並給一個 `VBox` 或是你也可以選擇其他的 `Node`。

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
    }
}
```

然而，若要真正的顯示一些東西在畫面上，我們想要填充 `VBox` 來當作 `root` 的元件，使用 [initializer block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors) 來創建 JavaFX 的 `Button` 和 `Label`。

請注意導入 (import) `tornadofx.*`，這會導入所有 TornadoFX 相關的檔案。如果沒有這樣導入，有一些較特殊的方法沒有辦法被 IDE 發現，這樣導入讓你不會缺少你會需要用到的一些重要方法。

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press me")
        label("Waiting")
    }
}
```

TorandoFX 提供 builder 方法來減少 UI code，而不用創建 UI 來手動的將其添加到元件列表，builder 允許我們用有層次的結構來表達我們的 UI，可以用非常簡單的方法來創建 UI。

請注意所有的 `builder` 都是使用小寫英文字，這樣才不會和手動創建 UI 類別搞混。

## 執行一個 TornadoFX 應用程式

最新的 JAM 版本知道要如何在沒有 `main()` 方法的形況下執行 JavaFX 的應用程式。因為 `tornadofx.App` 繼承了 `javafx.application.Application`，所以兩者在執行上並無區別，因此，你直接可以執行 `com.example.app.MyApp`，而不用使用 `main()` 方法。

下面的事例是使用包層級 (package level) 的 main() 方法：

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  launch<MyApp>(args)
}
```

這個 main 方法會被編譯為 `com.example.app.MyAppKt`，注意結尾為 `Kt`。當你創建了一個包層級 (package lavel) 的 main 方法，就會自動創建一個名稱為檔名加上 `Kt` 的類別。

要啟動和測試 `App`，我們可以使用 Intellij IDEA，步驟如下： *Run*→*Edit Configurations*

![3.1](https://i.imgur.com/msTSPNm.png)

點擊綠色 "+" 新增一個 Application configuration。

![3.2](https://i.imgur.com/OeejuvB.png)

輸入你的 Main class 名稱，也就是你的類別 `App` 的名稱。還必須指定 module，和一個有意義的名稱 (下面是用 Launcher)。

![3.3](https://i.imgur.com/0QayTdJ.png)

要啟動 TornadoFX 應用程式，選擇 *Run*→*Run 'Launcher'* 或是任何你定義的名稱。

![3.4](https://i.imgur.com/9HvQpTe.png)

這樣你就可以看到程式執行。

![3.5](https://i.imgur.com/agTMNS3.png)

恭喜，你成功完成了你的第一個 TorandoFX 程式，雖然現在看起來很簡單，但隨著我們介紹跟多的 TornadoFX 厲害的功能，我們就可以創建更大更令人印象深刻的程式，且只需要少量的程式碼。讓我們先來了更深入的解 `App` 和 `View`。

## 了解 Views

讓我們來深入的了解 `View` 的工作模式和引用的方法。一個 `View` 提供階層式的 JavaFX 節點，並且從 root 開始。在下一個部份，我們會學習如何利用建構器來創建 `Node` 結構。TornadoFX 只有管理一個 `MyView` 來確保只有單一物件 (singleton)。TornadoFX 還支援了 scopes，可以讓 `View`、`Fragment`、`Controller` 保持在同一個群組，讓 `View` 確保只有單一物件。這非常適合 [Multiple-Document Interface applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa263481.aspx)。

## Embedding Views

You can also inject one or more Views into another `View`. Below we embed a `TopView` and `BottomView` into a `MasterView`. We assign these sub views to sections inside the `BorderPane` (Figure 3.6).

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.Label
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane
import tornadofx.*


class MasterView: View() {
    override val root = borderpane {
        top<TopView>()
        bottom<BottomView>()
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = label("Bottom View")
}

```


## Injection Using find() or inject()

The `inject()` delegate will lazily assign a given component to a property. The first time that component is called is when it will be retrieved.
Alternatively, instead of using the `inject()` delegate you can use the `find()` function to retrieve a singleton instance of a `View` or other components. In the following example
we retrieve an instance of the `TopView` and `BottomView` using `inject()` and `find()` respectively, and assign the root element of those sub views to the sections inside the `BorderPane`.
This is normally not necessary but might help you understand how the above short hand works under the covers.

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.Label
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane
import tornadofx.*


class MasterView : View() {
    // Explicitly retrieve TopView
    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    // Create a lazy reference to BottomView
    val bottomView: BottomView by inject()

    override val root = borderpane {
        top = topView.root
        bottom = bottomView.root
    }
}
```
You can use either `find()` or `inject()`, but using `inject()` delegates is the most idiomatic means to perform dependency injection and has the advantage of lazy loading.


## Controllers

In many cases, it is considered a good practice to separate a UI into three distinct parts:

1. **Model** - The business code layer that holds core logic and data
2.  **View** - The visual display with various input and output controls
3.  **Controller** - The "middleman" mediating events between the Model and the View

> There are other flavors of MVC like MVVM and MVP, all of which can be leveraged in TornadoFX.

While you could put all logic from the Model and Controller right into the view, it is often cleaner to separate these three pieces distinctly to maximize reusability. One commonly used pattern to accomplish this is the MVC pattern. In TornadoFX, a `Controller` can be injected to support a `View`.

Here is a simple example. Create a simple `View` with a `TextField` whose value is bound to an observable string property and later written to a "database" when a `Button` is clicked. We can inject a `Controller` that handles interacting with the model that writes to the database. Since this example is simplified, there will be no database but a printed message will serve as a placeholder (Figure 3.7).


```kotlin
import tornadofx.*


class MyView : View() {
    val controller: MyController by inject()
    val input = SimpleStringProperty()

    override val root = form {
        fieldset {
            field("Input") {
                textfield(input)
            }

            button("Commit") {
                action {
                    controller.writeToDb(input.value)
                    input.value = ""
                }
            }
       }
    }
}


class MyController: Controller() {
    fun writeToDb(inputValue: String) {
        println("Writing $inputValue to database!")
    }
}
```

Notice how the `input` property is automatically bound to the textfield just by referencing it in the `textfield` builder. As an alternative, you could have created a
reference to the textfield and retrieved its `text` property, but that approach would create more complex UI code without much benefit. In rare cases you might
need to reference individual UI elements.

**Figure 3.7**

![](https://i.imgur.com/CKG7Fb9.png)

When we build the UI, we make sure to add a reference to the `inputField` so that it can be referenced from the `onClick`
event handler of the "Commit" button later, hence why we save it to a variable. When the "Commit" button is clicked, you will see the Controller prints  a line to the console.

```
Writing Alpha to database!
```

It is important to note that while the above code works, and may even look pretty good, it is a good practice to avoid
referencing other UI elements directly. Your code will be much easier to refactor if you bind your UI elements to
properties and manipulate the properties instead. We will introduce the `ViewModel` later, which provides even easier
ways to deal with this type of interaction.

You can also use Controllers to provide data to a `View` (Figure 3.8).

```kotlin
import javafx.collections.FXCollections
import tornadofx.*


class MyView : View() {
    val controller: MyController by inject()

    override val root = vbox {
        label("My items")
        listview(controller.values)
    }
}

class MyController: Controller() {
    val values = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta")
}
```
**Figure 3.8**

![](https://i.imgur.com/oKL9ZVD.png)

The `VBox` contains a `Label` and a `ListView`, and the `items` property of the `ListView` is assigned to the `values` property of our `Controller`.

Whether they are reading or writing data, Controllers can have long-running tasks and should not perform work on the JavaFX thread. We will learn how to easily offload work to a worker thread using the `runAsync` construct next.

### Long Running Tasks

Whenever you call a function in a controller, you need to determine if that function returns immediately or if it
performs potentially long-running tasks. If you call a function on the JavaFX Application Thread, the UI
will be unresponsive until the call completes. Unresponsive UI's is a killer for user acceptance, so we need to make sure to run expensive operations in the background. TornadoFX provides the `runAsync` function to help with this.

Code placed inside a `runAsync` block will run in the background. If the result of the background call should update your UI, you must make sure that you apply the changes on the JavaFX Application Thread. The `ui` block, which typically follows, does exactly that.

```kotlin
val textfield = textfield()
button("Update text") {
    action {
        runAsync {
            myController.loadText()
        } ui { loadedText ->
            textfield.text = loadedText
        }
    }
}
```

When the button is clicked, the action inside the `action` builder is run. It makes a call out to `myController.loadText()`and applies the result to the text property of the textfield when it returns. The UI stays responsive while the controller function runs.

Under the covers, `runAsync` creates a JavaFX `Task` objects, and spins off a separate thread to run your call inside the `Task`. You can even assign this `Task` to a variable and bind it to a UI to show progress while your operation is running.

In fact, this is so common that there is also a default ViewModel called `TaskStatus` which contains observable values
 for `running`, `message`, `title`, and `progress`. You can supply the `runAsync` call with a specific instance of the `TaskStatus` object, or use the default. There is also a version of `runAsync` called `runAsyncWithProgress` which will cover the current `Node` with a progress indicator while the long running operation runs.

The TornadoFX sources includes an example usage of this in the `AsyncProgressApp.kt` file.

> If you need to handle a great deal of complex concurrency, you may consider using [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin) with [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX). Rx also has the ability to handle rapid user inputs and events, and kill previous requests to only chase after the latest.

## Fragment

Any `View` you create is a singleton, which means you typically use it in only one place at a time. The reason for this is that the root node of the `View` can only have a single parent in a JavaFX application. If you assign it another parent, it will disappear from its previous parent.

However, if you would like to create a piece of UI that is short-lived or can be used in multiple places, consider using
a `Fragment`. A **Fragment** is a special type of `View` designed to have multiple instances. They are particularly useful for popups or as pieces of a larger UI (such as ListCells, which we look at via the `ListCellFragment` later).

Both `View` and `Fragment` support `openModal()`, `openWindow()`, and `openInternalWindow()` functions that will open the root node in a separate Window.

```kotlin
import javafx.stage.StageStyle
import tornadofx.*


class MyView : View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press Me") {
            action {
                find<MyFragment>().openModal(stageStyle = StageStyle.UTILITY)
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyFragment: Fragment() {
    override val root = label("This is a popup")
}
```

You can also pass optional arguments to `openModal()` to modify a few of its behaviors

**Optional Arguments for openModal()**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|stageStyle|StageStyle|Defines one of the possible enum styles for `Stage`. Default: `StageStyle.DECORATED`|
|modality|Modality|Defines one of the possible enum modality types for `Stage`. Default: `Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL`|
|escapeClosesWindow|Boolean|Sets the `ESC` key to call `close()`. Default: `true`|
|owner|Window|Specify the owner Window for this Stage`|
|block|Boolean|Block UI execution until the Window closes. Default: `false`|

## InternalWindow

While `openModal` opens in a new `Stage`, `openInternalWindow` opens over the current root node, or any other node if you specify it:

```kotlin
    button("Open editor") {
        action {
            openInternalWindow<Editor>()
        }
    }
```

**Figure 3.9**

![](https://i.imgur.com/7Z0X5QL.png)

A good use case for the internal window is for single stage environments like JPro, or if you want to customize the window trim to make the window appear more in line with the design of your application. The Internal Window can be styled with CSS. Take a look at the `InternalWindow.Styles` class for more information about styleable properties.

The internal window API differs from modal/window in one important aspect. Since the window opens over an existing node, you typically call `openInternalWindow()` from within the `View` you want it to open on top of. You supply the View you want to show, and you can optionally supply what node to open over via the `owner` parameter.

**Optional Arguments for openInternalWindow()**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|view|UIComponent|The component will be the content of the new window|
|view|KClass<UIComponent>|Alternatively, you can supply the class of the view instead of an instance|
|icon|Node|Optional window icon|
|scope|Scope|If you specify the view class, you can also specify the scope used to fetch the view|
|modal|Boolean|Defines if the covering node should be disabled while the internal window is active. Default: `true`|
|escapeClosesWindow|Boolean|Sets the `ESC` key to call `close()`. Default: `true`|
|owner|Node|Specify the owner Node for this window. The window will by default cover the root node of this view.`|

## Closing Modal Windows

Any `Component` opened using `openModal()`, `openWindow()` or `openInternalWindow()` can be closed by calling `close()`. It is also possible to get to the `InternalWindow` instance directly if needed using `findParentOfType(InternalWindow::class)`.

## Replacing Views and Docking Events

With TornadoFX, is easy to swap your current `View` with another `View` using `replaceWith()`, and optionally add a transition. In the example below, a `Button` on each `View` will switch to the other view, which can be `MyView1` or `MyView2` (Figure 3.10).

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*


class MyView1: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView2") {
            action {
                replaceWith<MyView2>()
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyView2: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView1") {
            action {
                replaceWith<MyView1>()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 3.10**

![](https://i.imgur.com/IkInGZh.png)


You also have the option to specify a spiffy animation for the transition between the two Views, as shown below.

```kotlin
replaceWith(MyView1::class, ViewTransition.Slide(0.3.seconds, ViewTransition.Direction.LEFT))
```

This works by replacing the `root` `Node` on a given `View` with another `View`'s `root`. There are two functions you can override on `View` to leverage when a View's `root` `Node` is connected to a parent (`onDock()`), and when it is disconnected (`onUndock()`). You can leverage these two events to connect and "clean up" whenever a `View` comes in or falls out. You will notice running the code below that whenever a `View` is swapped, it will undock that previous `View` and dock the new one. You can leverage these two events to manage initialization and disposal tasks.

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*


class MyView1: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView2") {
            action {
                replaceWith<MyView2>()
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onDock() {
        println("Docking MyView1!")
    }

    override fun onUndock() {
        println("Undocking MyView1!")
    }
}

class MyView2: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView1") {
            action {
                replaceWith<MyView1>()
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onDock() {
        println("Docking MyView2!")
    }
    override fun onUndock() {
        println("Undocking MyView2!")
    }
}
```

## Passing Parameters to Views

The best way to pass information between views is often an injected `ViewModel`. Even so, it can still be convenient to be able to pass parameters to other components. The `find` and `inject` functions supports varargs of `Pair<String, Any>` which can be used for just this purpose. Consider a customer list that opens a customer editor for the selected customer. The action to edit a customer might look like this:

```kotlin
fun editCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    find<CustomerEditor>(mapOf(CustomerEditor::customer to customer)).openWindow()
}
```

The parameters are passed as a map, where the key is the property in the view and the value is whatever you want the property to be. This gives you a type safe way of configuring parameters for the target View.

Here we use the Kotlin `to` syntax to create the parameter. This could also have been written as `Pair(CustomerEditor::customer, customer)` if you prefer. The editor can now access the parameter like this:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor : Fragment() {
    val customer: Customer by param()
}
```

If you want to inspect the parameters instead of blindly relying on them to be available, you can either declare them as nullable or consult the `params` map:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor : Fragment() {
    init {
        val customer = params["customer"] as? Customer
        if (customer != null) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

If you do not care about type safety you can also pass parameters as `mapOf("customer" to customer)`, but then you miss out on automatic refactoring if you rename a property in the target view.

## Accessing the Primary Stage

`View` has a property called `primaryStage` that allows you to manipulate properties of the `Stage` backing it, such as window size. Any `View` or `Fragment` that were opened via `openModal` will also have a `modalStage` property available.

## Accessing the Scene

Sometimes it is necessary to get a hold of the current scene from within a `View` or `Fragment`. This can be achieved with `root.scene`, or if you are within a type safe builder, just call `scene`.

## Accessing Resources

Lots of JavaFX APIs takes resources as a `URL` or the `toExternalForm` of an URL. To retrieve a resource url one would typically write something like:

```kotlin
val myAudioClip = AudioClip(MyView::class.java.getResource("mysound.wav").toExternalForm())
```

However, every `Component` has a `resources` object which can retrieve the external form url of a resource like this:

```kotlin
val myAudiClip = AudioClip(resources["mysound.wav"])
```

If you need an actual `URL`, it can be retrieved like this:

```kotlin
val myResourceURL = resources.url("mysound.wav")
```

The `resources` helper also has several other helpful functions to help you turn files relative to the `Component` into an object of the type you need:

```kotlin
val myJsonObject = resources.json("myobject.json")
val myJsonArray = resources.jsonArray("myarray.json")
val myStream = resources.stream("somefile")
```

>It is worth mentioning that the `json` and `jsonArray` functions are also available on `InputStream` objects.

Resources are relative to the `Component` but you can also retrieve a resource by it's full path, starting with a `/`.


## Summary

TornadoFX is filled with simple, streamlined, and powerful injection tools to manage Views and Controllers. It also streamlines dialogs and other small UI pieces using `Fragment`. While the applications we built so far are pretty simple, hopefully you appreciate the simplified concepts TornadoFX introduces to JavaFX. In the next chapter we will cover what is arguably the most powerful feature of TornadoFX: Type-Safe Builders.
